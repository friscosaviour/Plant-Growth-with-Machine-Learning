## **Further Improvements and Considerations:**

- **State Representation:**
    - **Normalization:** Properly normalize sensor data before binning if their scales are vastly different.
    - **Binning Strategy:** Experiment with the number of bins.
    - **Feature Engineering:** You could add features like "time since last watered."
- **Reward Shaping:** This is key. Spend time refining the reward function. Small penalties for actions (like watering) can encourage efficiency.
- **More Complex Actions:** If you have actuators for light or temperature, add them to the action space. This will significantly increase the complexity and the size of the Q-table.
- **Advanced RL Algorithms:**
    - For larger state spaces or continuous actions, Q-Learning becomes impractical. Consider:
        - **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function, handling larger/continuous state spaces better.
        - **Policy Gradient Methods (e.g., A2C, PPO):** If you have continuous actions (e.g., "water for X seconds").
- **Simulation Accuracy:** The more realistic your PlantGrowthEnv simulation, the better your agent will perform in the real world (if you plan to deploy it). This is a big challenge.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** learning_rate, discount_factor, epsilon decay schedule, and num_bins will need tuning.
- **Real-world Deployment:** Bridging the gap from simulation to a real physical system (the "sim2real" problem) is non-trivial. The real world has noise, delays, and unmodelled dynamics.
