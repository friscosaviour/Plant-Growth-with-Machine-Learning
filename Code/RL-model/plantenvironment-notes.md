Normalization: The current code assumes your CSV data for humidity, temperature, and light is somewhat normalized (e.g., 0-1 or similar scale) or that the np.linspace for bins will cover their actual ranges. You might need to scale sensor readings to a consistent range (e.g., 0 to 1) before binning, based on their known minimum and maximum possible values. The current binning uses min/max from the provided CSV, which might not be the true operational min/max of the sensors.
Simulation Dynamics: The drying logic (drying_factor) and watering effect (+= 0.1 to 0.2) are very simplistic. You'd ideally tune these based on real plant behavior or more sophisticated models.
CSV Usage: The CSV is used here to provide exogenous factors (humidity, temp, light) that change over time but are not directly controlled by the agent's water action. This makes the environment more dynamic.
Reward Function: This is critical. Experiment with different reward structures. The current one heavily prioritizes soil moisture.
Discretization (num_bins): The number of bins affects the size of your state space. Too few, and you lose information. Too many, and Q-learning becomes slow to converge (curse of dimensionality).
